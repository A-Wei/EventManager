## Event_Manager

### Welcom ###
Welcome to `Event Manager` Repo, this is the breakable toy project for my apprenticeship.

### Functionality ###
General functionality of this web application is similar to Facebook Events, where you can search and show interest of an event, also 'check-in' and 'check-out'.

### Build for ###
This webapp is designed for workshop, conference, event, class organizers which they can

1. Knwo how many people will join and how many actually showed up
2. Randomly selecting a person from checked-in users to give prizes
3. analyze your attendents
4. Download the attendance list and calculate attendance rate for classes

### Note ###
Note, for the check-in check-out functionality, prefered to use mobile app to scan qr code which refresh every second.
Not sure if I can implement this qr code in this version, so I will start with check-in and out with simple buttons on web.
