## Event_Manager

### Welcome
Welcome to `Event Manager` Repo, this is the breakable toy project.
Stories are tracked in [Monday.com](https://universalavenue.monday.com/boards/173844071/?advancedFilters=true)

### Functionality
General functionality of this web application is similar to Facebook Events, where you can search and show interest of an event, also 'check-in' and 'check-out'.

### Where it might get used
This webapp is designed for workshop, conference, event, class organizers which they can

1. Knwo how many people will join and how many actually showed up
2. Randomly selecting a person from checked-in users to give prizes
3. analyze your attendents
4. Download the attendance list and calculate attendance rate for classes

### Note
Note, for the check-in check-out functionality, prefered to use mobile app to scan qr code which refresh every second.
Not sure if I can implement this qr code in this version, so I will start with check-in and out with simple buttons on web.
